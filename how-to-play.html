                    It's easy, just try to not put the queens against each other so they dont eat each other. <br>
                    You cant put the queens in a blue colored square, cause if you did you make them eat each other <br>
                    Be smart, you can only finished the game on a 4 square board or more. You can try if you want. <br>
                    We also have the solver, but be quite cause it means you are actually cheating! <br>
                    The more queens you insert, the more solution you have, so enjoy the game!
